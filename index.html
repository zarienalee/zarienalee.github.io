    <p>I am an aspiring web developer. What I lack in experience I make up for with a passion for learning and a curious mind. I have always been a problem solver and someone who enjoys working hard. During this year I have developed a strong passion for code and what it can do in the real world. I do not have a technical backround, but do have experience in working in teams and in being creative when it comes to solving issues that arise.
        I have completed two years of a BA in English and Media at the University of Cape Town. I am a team player, determined and am not afriad to admit when I am wrong.
